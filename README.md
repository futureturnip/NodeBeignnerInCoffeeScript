# The Node Beginner's Book Example in CoffeeScript

I started programming in the era when to play a game, you had to type it in by hand. To this day, I still learn best by following along with an extended tutorial; getting it to work initially and then playing around with it to see what happens.

I was delighted to find Manuel Kiessling's [The Node Beginner's Book]. What a little gem of a tutorial. It starts from the obligatory node http application, and then extends it to deal with real world problems like asynchronous handlers, listening to events, organizing the code, and more; without going toO deep. As he states, it's designed to be the tutorial he wishes he had when he first started, and you'll go from beginner to advanced beginner.

## The code in this repository

This repository is the current state of my riff on his example. I'm really digging [CoffeeScript], so I decided it would help to re-create the sample in CoffeeScript. There are some parts of my code that I think could be prettier. There are some discoveries you may find useful, but please buy the book and follow along for yourself.
